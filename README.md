This is an extended version of the previously created NodeGraph command line application which extends and build on top of it.
The aim of this update is to:
1) Refactor and make the code cleaner
2) Create a Class Library (DLL) for the internal methods and workings of the app.
3) Create a separate command-line UI project which uses the aforementioned DLL.
